	abstract = {This paper presents the wind data analysis for five coastal locations of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, namely Dhahran, Yanbo, Al-Wajh, Jeddah, and Gizan. The data analysis utilized hourly mean values of wind speed and wind direction covering a period of almost 14 years between 1970 and 1983. The data were validated in terms of completeness, continuity, erroneous values, etc. The analyses include seasonal and diurnal changes in wind speed values. Energy calculations and capacity factors were also determined for wind machines of different sizes between 150 and 2500 {kW}. It was found that Yanbo is the best location, among the sites analyzed, for harnessing the power of wind, while Dhahran is the next best location. The other three locations were found to have more or less the same results.},

	abstract = {This study combines multi-year mesoscale modeling results, validated using offshore buoys with high-resolution bathymetry to create a wind energy resource assessment for offshore California ({CA}). The siting of an offshore wind farm is limited by water depth, with shallow water being generally preferable economically. Acceptable depths for offshore wind farms are divided into three categories: ≤20 m depth for monopile turbine foundations, ≤50 m depth for multi-leg turbine foundations, and ≤200 m depth for deep water floating turbines. The {CA} coast was further divided into three logical areas for analysis: Northern, Central, and Southern {CA}. A mesoscale meteorological model was then used at high horizontal resolution (5 and 1.67 km) to calculate annual 80 m wind speeds (turbine hub height) for each area, based on the average of the seasonal months January, April, July, and October of 2005/2006 and the entirety of 2007 (12 months). A 5 {MW} offshore wind turbine was used to create a preliminary resource assessment for offshore {CA}. Each geographical region was then characterized by its coastal transmission access, water depth, wind turbine development potential, and average 80 m wind speed. Initial estimates show that 1.4–2.3 {GW}, 4.4–8.3 {GW}, and 52.8–64.9 {GW} of deliverable power could be harnessed from offshore {CA} using monopile, multi-leg, and floating turbine foundations, respectively. A single proposed wind farm near Cape Mendocino could deliver an average 800 {MW} of gross renewable power and reduce {CA}'s current carbon emitting electricity generation 4\% on an energy basis. Unlike most of California's land based wind farms which peak at night, the offshore winds near Cape Mendocino are consistently fast throughout the day and night during all four seasons.},

	abstract = {In Saudi Arabia, fossil-fuel is the main source of power generation. Due to the huge economic and demographic growth, the electricity consumption in Saudi Arabia has increased and should continue to increase at a very fast rate. At the moment, more than half a million barrels of oil per day is used directly for power generation. Herein, we assess the power generation situation of the country and its future conditions through a modelling approach. For this purpose, we present the current situation by detailing the existing generation mix of electricity. Then we develop an optimization model of the power sector which aims to define the best production and investment pattern to reach the expected demand. Subsequently, we will carry out a sensitivity analysis so as to evaluate the robustness of the model's by taking into account the integration variability of the other alternative (non-fossil fuel based) resources. The results point out that the choices of investment in the power sector strongly affect the potential oil's exports of Saudi Arabia. For instance, by decarbonizing half of its generation mix, Saudi Arabia can release around 0.5 Mb/d barrels of oil equivalent per day from 2020. Moreover, total power generation cost reduction can reach up to around 28\% per year from 2030 if Saudi Arabia manages to attain the most optimal generation mix structure introduced in the model (50\% of power from renewables and nuclear power plants and 50\% from the fossil power plants).},
