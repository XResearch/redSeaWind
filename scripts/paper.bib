The main types of pollutants emitted from the plant are: Hydro–carbons {HC}, carbon monoxide {CO}, Nitrogen oxides {NO} x and sulfur dioxide {SO} 2 . Thermal stability classes for Jeddah city are estimated for the months of the year (2007). It was found that the dominant stability class for the city is the moderately unstable class B (according to pasquill classification). The results of stability classes’ evaluation together with the meteorological wind—data are used to predict the ground level concentration (glc) of the pollutants against the downwind distance from the plant location. The month and day of each calculated value of the pollutant concentration during the year (2007) have been specified. The maximum (glc) and their positions on the ground for each pollutant are found.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the wind data analysis for five coastal locations of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, namely Dhahran, Yanbo, Al-Wajh, Jeddah, and Gizan. The data analysis utilized hourly mean values of wind speed and wind direction covering a period of almost 14 years between 1970 and 1983. The data were validated in terms of completeness, continuity, erroneous values, etc. The analyses include seasonal and diurnal changes in wind speed values. Energy calculations and capacity factors were also determined for wind machines of different sizes between 150 and 2500 {kW}. It was found that Yanbo is the best location, among the sites analyzed, for harnessing the power of wind, while Dhahran is the next best location. The other three locations were found to have more or less the same results.},

This study proposes to assess wind power cost per {kWh} of electricity produced using three types of wind electric conversion systems at 20 locations within the Kingdom. These sites cover the eastern, central, and western regions. Hourly values of wind speed recorded for periods of 5.5–13 years (between 1970–1982, in most cases) were used for all 20 locations. Wind duration curves were developed and utilized to calculate the cost per {kWh} of electricity generated from three chosen wind-machines.},
